# TeamEasier

### Note : This is a work in progress

A Golang wrapper for the TeamWork API service. The applicaiton also has a gRPC server if you want to deploy your own server and have your applications
interface with this gRPC server instead. Use cases for this: 

- When you don't have an API wrapper available for your language.
- You are more comfortable using gRPC than implementing the REST API.
